## Development

If you want to contribute code, it is very useful for you to read [the develop documentation](docs/develop.md)

## Fork

Contributor only allow to fork [main branch](https://github.com/Websoft9/docker-library/tree/main) and pull request for it. Maintainers don't accept any pr to **production branch**

## Branch

This repository have these branchs:

- **Contributor's branch**: Develpoer can fork main branch as their delelopment branch anytime
- **main branch**: The only branch that accepts PR from Contributors's branch
- **production branch**: For version release and don't permit modify directly, only merge PR from **main branch**

Flow: Contributor's branch → main branch → production branch

## Pull request

[Pull request](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests) let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.

#### When is PR produced?

- Contributor commit to main branch
- main branch commit to production branch

#### How to deal with PR?

## DevOps principle

DevOps thinks the same way **[5m1e](https://www.dgmfmoldclamps.com/what-is-5m1e-in-injection-molding-industry/)** for manufacturing companies

We follow the development principle of minimization, rapid release

### Version

Use _[[major].[minor].[patch]](https://semver.org/lang/zh-CN/)_ for version serial number and [version.json](../version.json) for version dependencies

### Artifact

Websoft9 use below [Artifact](https://jfrog.com/devops-tools/article/what-is-a-software-artifact/) for different usage:

- **Dockerhub for image**: Access [Websoft9 docker images](https://hub.docker.com/u/websoft9dev) on Dockerhub
- **Azure Storage for files**: Access [packages list](https://artifact.azureedge.net/release?restype=container&comp=list) at [Azure Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-dotnet-how-to-use-blobs#list-the-blobs-in-a-container)

### Tags

- Type tags: Bug, enhancement, Documetation
- Stages Tags: PRD, Dev, QA(include deployment), Documentation

### WorkFlow

Websoft9 use the [Production branch with GitLab flow](https://cm-gitlab.stanford.edu/help/workflow/gitlab_flow.md#production-branch-with-gitlab-flow) for development collaboration

> [gitlab workflow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html) is improvement model for git
