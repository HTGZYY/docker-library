# Rewards

As an open source repository, we reward contributors who solved our issues and ensure better progress for this repository in the future.

We will also carry out various of communication activities:

2. Invite contributors to participate in tourism, and websoft9 is responsible for tourism expenses
3. Hold an annual meeting, we will select outstanding contributors of the year and give rewards ranging from ¥ 1000 to ¥ 3000

## How to pricing an issue?

There are two rules for measuring an issue: workload and difficulty.

- An issue total reward = Research reward + Implementation reward
- For the convenience of calculation, the workload completed within a unit size is considered as a **work-point**, a work-point's price is ￥ 30.
- work-point refer to Technical popularity, Developer stacks, Document reading ability
- High, Middle, Low
