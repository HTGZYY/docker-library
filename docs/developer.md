# Develop

## [Docker-compose](../template/docker-compose.yml)

### Use official docker image

Try to use the official image as much as possible, unless there is no maintenance or updates have been stopped.

### Microservices

The images used should be componentized as much as possible, with app main images and DB images, and web server images connected to achieve software availability.

### Networks

All containers are placed on the same network, making them accessible to each other through container names.

### Volumes

Do not use absolute paths, reference by defining volumes.

## Env_file

All of the apps must include an .env file, add **env_file** item at [docker-compose.yml](../template/docker-compose.yml) for important container which includes lots of environments

### How to include

It is included in container's propert env_file, like this:

```
services:
  suitecrm:
    image: docker.io/bitnami/suitecrm:${APP_VERSION}
    container_name: ${APP_NAME}
    restart: unless-stopped
    env_file:
      - .env
```

### Generic variable

- APP_NAME: It is required in .env file, main container is setted with APP_NAME.

> When the container has web pages, the corresponding container of the page is the main container; When a container has no pages, the corresponding container for the core application is usually the main container

- APP_VERSION: It is required in .env file, the app's version.

- APP_NETWORK: It is required in .env file, We uniformly place all apps under the network named APP_NETWORK to facilitate connections before the container

- POWER_PASSWORD: If app or db have password, init password is POWER_PASSWORD. APP_PASSWORD and DB_PASSWORD uses it to assign values and maintain the same password for one app

- APP_HTTP_PORT: When the container has web pages, use it to map to an external network port for internet access.

- APP_URL: It is used when the application APP needs to set an external URL, which can be IP(or domain), IP:PORT, http(s)://IP:PORT

- APP_URL_REPLACE: modifies APP_URL on init when it is true

- APP_ADMIN_PATH: App's background access address

- APP_HTTPS_ACCESS: some container (e.g teleport) need HTTPS access, then need to set this pra

#### DB related variable

The database type needs to be included in the middle of the variable, such as mysql,mongodb,postgresql,(e.g mysql):

```
APP_DB_MYSQL_VERSION=5.7
APP_DB_MYSQL_PORT=3306
APP_DB_MYSQL_PASSWORD=$APP_PASSWORD
APP_DB_MYSQL_NAME=$APP_NAME
APP_DB_MYSQL_USER=$APP_NAME
```

## Credentials

## Logs limit

Some application have lots of logs which will need storages. If you want to limit it, below is referance

```
  wordpress:
    image: wordpress:$APP_VERSION
    container_name: $APP_NAME
    restart: unless-stopped
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
          max-file: "5"
          max-size: 10m
```

## PHP configuration

1. Docker official image or Bitnami image have different method for php configuration
2. Docker official image need mount php_exra.ini to container
3. Bitnami image have envs of php configuration

## variables.json

- version format: x.x.x
