# Paid

We will give various rewards to the contributors in different situations.

## Work mode

Contributors get rewards by completing issues. The amount of completed the total issue is reward of this month.

### How to fix issue price

There are two main criteria for measuring an issue: workload and difficulty.

> issue reward=workload \* weighted difficulty

#### Workload

For the convenience of calculation, the workload completed within a unit size is considered as a **work-point**.
