We will give various rewards to the contributors in different situations.  

Contributors get rewards by completing issues. The amount of completed the total issue is reward of this month.

We will also carry out various forms of communication activities:

2. Invite contributors to participate in tourism, and websoft9 is responsible for tourism expenses
3. Hold an annual meeting, we will select outstanding contributors of the year and give rewards ranging from ¥ 1000 to ¥ 3000


## How to pricing an issue?

There are two rules for measuring an issue: workload and difficulty.

> issue reward=workload \* average weighted difficulty

* An issue total reward = Research reward + Implementation reward
* For the convenience of calculation, the workload completed within a unit size is considered as a **work-point**, a work-point's price is ￥30.
* work-point refer to Technical popularity, Developer stacks, Document reading ability
* High, Middle, Low


| Item Group           | Item   | Item workload     | Skill | work-point |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- | ---------- | --------- | --------- |
| Research | Confirmable procedure | official references docs | L | 1-2        |
|  | No-Confirmable procedure | references, you solution(why, how) | H    | 3-8        |
| Implementation | Dockerfile | process, runtime, cmd.sh or entrypoint.sh     | M | 1-3        |
|  | docker-compose.yml | service, exra cmd.sh or entrypoint.sh         | M       | 1-3        |
|                | .env | environments ammount that can not use default | M       | 1-2        |

An issue max work-point：(1+1+1+2+2+1+1)=9


## How to pay for issues?

We will pay to contributor before tenth for every month for the previous month's rewards.

Monthly performance is related to two factors: Quantity and Quality

| Close issue quantity | reward | reduce |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------ |
| 0~9                  | -      | -      |
| 10~19                | ￥ 300 | -      |
| 20~                  | ￥ 800 | -      |

| Close issue quality                                                              | reward        | reduce         |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Communicated through the phone and sent 4th pull_requests cannot close the issue | -             | ￥ 100\*issues |
| First pull_request and close the issue                                           | ￥ 50\*issues | -              |
